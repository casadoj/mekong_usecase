# A LISFLOOD use case: the Nam Ngum River Basin (Mekong)

This is a simple example of how a catchment model can be developed using the hydrological model LISFLOOD.

The first section introduces the study area and shows the required input data for the model; a general introduction to the settings is also presented. The following three sections represent each of the three runs we will carry out in this project. In each section we will present the objetive of that run, the specific settings of that run and we will visualize and explain some of the results.

More information about LISFLOOD can be found both in its [model documentation](#https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-model/) and the [user guide](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-code/).
